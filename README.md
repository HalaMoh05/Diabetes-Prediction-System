Project Overview:
This project aims to build a Diabetes Prediction System that predicts whether a person is at risk of diabetes based on medical indicators using a Machine Learning model. The system includes a web interface developed with Flask, allowing users to input their data and receive predictions instantly.

Web Application Development
Backend:
•	Built with Flask.
•	Loads the trained model (diabetes_model.pkl).
•	Receives user input via web form, processes the data, and predicts diabetes risk.
Frontend:
•	Developed using HTML and CSS.
•	A simple form where users can input:
o	Pregnancies
o	Glucose
o	Blood Pressure
o	Skin Thickness
o	Insulin
o	BMI
o	Diabetes Pedigree Function
o	Age
•	Displays the prediction:
o	"High Risk of Diabetes" or "Low Risk of Diabetes"
Frontend Enhancements:
•	The web interface was later enhanced with a modern, responsive design.
•	Medical context tips were added next to each input field to improve usability and user awareness.
•	Visual indicators and styled result alerts distinguish between high and low risk.
